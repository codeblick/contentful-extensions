# Contentful extensions

This folder contains a set of extensions using the [UI extensions SDK](https://github.com/contentful/ui-extensions-sdk).

## SERP Generator

This extension adds a preview for url, meta title and meta description. The field itself doesn't contain the url. 
It will search for a field called "slug" in the same entry.

[You can find a demo here.](https://codeblick.github.io/contentful-extensions/serp/demo.html)

If you wan't to install the extension just pass this url to contentful:
